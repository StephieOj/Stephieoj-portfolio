# Project Outline

## Setup

1. Created design in Figma

1. Create new repo with Github

2. Created file structure

    index.html
  
    about.html
  
    portfolio.html
  
    contact.html
  
    src-    
    This is where I will upload all my assets like images
  
    scripts-  
    script.js (This will be my main JS file)
 
    styles-  
    styles.css (This will be my main CSS file)
    

3. Added the Bootstrap CDN for CSS and JS
4. Linked my CSS and JS files to my index page
5. Added inital SEO meta e.g. title, desciption
6. Pushed initial commit to Github
7. Linked my CSS and JS files to my other pages, about, portfolio and contact
8. Added Bootstrap Navbar to all pages
9. Started working on the structure of my hero section
10. I also added a Contact me button 
11. I had fun with the CSS, lots of color and used some nice transitions to the button
12. The thing i'm most please with was styling the navbar, I was able to use the class nav-link to color the links in the navbar. I also found out I can change the background color and style of the navbar to match with my theme. The last thing I did to the navbar was use ms-auto to justify the links to the right hand side of the page. 


## Next Steps
- I want to add an image to the right hand side of the text in my hero section.
- Not sure if I want to add my social media links to my home page or just the contact me page. 
- Possibly add pictures of my projects that link to the portfolio page which will contain more info.
